Portal Test Chamber Sign Generator 1.1
====================
Updated for Ruby 1.9!
-----------------

In order for this to work properly, you must install prawn, prawn-core, prawn-layout, and awesome_print.

You can easily do this by going into the generator's directory and running:

     sudo gem install bundler
    
and:

     bundle install

then:

    ruby portal.rb
    
and the PDF will be in the output folder.


Unfortunately, I can't release the two font files that you need (Univers LT 49 Light Ultra Condensed and Univers LT Std Bold Condensed), but I'm sure you'll be able to figure that one out.

I do not own the Portal artwork.  That is (I'm sure) copyright and trademarked to Valve.
